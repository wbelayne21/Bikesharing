# Bikesharing
## Overview of the analysis:
  The purpose of the analysis is to investigate how Citi Bike works in New York City before presenting a proposal for launching a similar bike-sharing business in a Des Moines. We will use Tableau to create visualizations to understand trends related to Citi Bike.

Figure 3: A) Top 10 popular start locations and 

-	There was a total of 2,344,224 rides completed.
-	When comparing the average trip duration by birth year we notice that customers born after 1990 ride longer.
-	The top starting locations shows which areas in New York have more customers rent out the bikes. The map supports strong evidence that some locations have as high as 13,000 pick ups in the city and Bronx compared to 700 in Queens etc. 
-	Analysis of the type of customers reveals that 81% of the rides completed are by annual subscribers. 
-	Sampling August data shows that 5-6PM are the busiest for the bike-sharing business. This will help us avoid servicing bikes during that time to increase profitability. 
-	I created a comparison chart for average trip duration and the total of trip duration for each customer type. It is interesting to see that the average trip duration of customers is 2.5X bigger than that of subscribers. But total trip duration is twice bigger for subscribers. We can create a scheme to encourage subscribers and customers to ride for longer. 
-	I also created a visualization to see which stations are the most popular and which ones are the least. This will help us make business decisions depending on the availability of company resources i.e. allocate more bikes at the popular stations (possibly from the least popular stations). 
#### Summary: 
  From this visual analysis we can conclude that 5-6PM is the busiest time for bikes haring, men and subscribers are patrons that use the business the most. We also learned that people born later than 1990 rent the bikes out the longest. Analysis of the start and end times also gave us an insight into what the best times are for maintenance. 
I have created visualizations I suggest would help understand the type of users and stations that are popular. We can also further analyze the age group to see who rides the bikes the most and not just the longest.
